# Docker file for Apache Bloodhound 

**WARNING:** This container is ephemeral AND based on sqlite. You **WILL** lose all issues entered as soon as the container exits.

This thing should be linked to a MySQL container and modified accordingly. I am not even sure it is worth the effort when a VM would just do fine.
